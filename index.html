			I am a Senior at University of Massachusetts Lowell,<br>
		studying Computer Science. I have an interest in<br>
		programming and software development. Some of my <br>
		personal hobbies include playing instruments,<br>
		snowboarding, cars, making money, playing games, riding<br>
		my bike and any other kinds of activities. I have<br>
		lived and grown up in Lowell my whole life. My<br>
		previous work experience includes making pizza <br>
		since I was 14 as well as delivering and installing <br>
		windows and siding at 18. After college I <br>
		would like to pursue a career that combines <br>
		some of the things I am passionate about. <br>
		Idealy this would be a Software or another <br>
		Computer Science job that makes a lot of money.<br>
		With this I will be able to create a life style I have<br>
		wanted my whole life. To have a fast car, house with<br>
		a yard so I can mow the grass, many rooms for many<br>
		activities and lots of materialistic things.
